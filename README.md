# Linear-algebra-calculator
Work in progress calculator Im making to assist in my many linear algebra calculations. Not only is making this good coding experience and helps me later
for when i need a reliable and accurate calculator i can trust, but learning to code this out logically helps me better understand the reasoning for when i
do it in reality in person. All WIP rn, might do a calculus one or smth later we'll see
